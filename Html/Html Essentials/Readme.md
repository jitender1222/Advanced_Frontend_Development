## What is HTML??

Ans-> First of all Html is not a programming language.It's a markup language which was earlier introduced to enable the creation of hypertext documents that could be linked together through hyperlinks. These documents could contain text, images, and links, allowing users to navigate and access information in a non-linear way.

Now a days it is used to structure the content of a web page, define its layout, and specify how different elements on the page should be displayed in a web browser.

## Html Element

An html element is a component of an html document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part of HTML document.
It is a colllection of opening and a closing tag with a content inserted in between them.

<b>For Example</b>

```
<p> This is a paragraph </p>

```

<> -> it tells the browser where the content material starts.

</> -> it tells the browser where it ends

content -> it is actual thing which we have to display over the web page.

<b>Combining all three results as an HTML Element</b>

## Html tag

Html tags are like keyword with the help of this web browser will format and display the content also it will help to distinguish between an html content and a simple content.

Example -> `<p>,<image>,<h>` tags

<b>Note-> When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.</b>

## what happens when we write a normal text without using any tag ??

when we write a normal text without wrapping up inside any tag the browser automatically tries to wrap the content inside the tag

For example:

`My name is jitender` inside the browser when we inspect it will look like

`<body> My name is Jitender </body>`

## Inline vs Block tag

All tags which are inline can put the information on the same line.

<b>It does not break the line to put the content</b>

Example -> div tag

Tags which are block level can put the information on the different line.

<b>It will break the line to put the content</b>

For example -> span tag
