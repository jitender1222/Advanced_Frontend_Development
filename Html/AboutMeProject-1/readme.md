## what are attributes ??

All the HTML elements have attributes. Attributes are the additional information that can configure the elements or adjust their behaviour in various ways to meet the criteria the user wants.

The `a` tag defines a hyperlink. The <b>href</b> attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to here the href gives the additional info about the element.

## What are semantic tags ??

Semantics HTML elements are those which clearly describes their meaning so that the code becomes more readable.

```
The semantic elements added in HTML5 are:

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>

and many more ...

```

By using semantics tags it can increase the accessbility so that search engines are also able to understand the context and content of your website .
