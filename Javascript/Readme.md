# Pillars of Javascript

## There are 4 pillars of javascript 

1. Coercion -> it means `type conversion` whenever we do an operation based on some set of input we can actually convert the type of input.

These can be done into 2 ways.

1. explicit typecasting -> this conversion can be manually done by `us` as an developer or a user.

2. implicit typecasting -> this conversion can be done automatically which means the types of the input is being convert automatically and this process is known as `coercion` .
