## Scope

### Everything`(vairables and functions)` inside your code will be used in one of the following 2 ways :

1-> Either it will be getting some values assigned to it.

2-> Or Some value will be reterived from it.


### `Compiler` read the whole code at once and tell us these are the errors if it is present.

Examples -> C,C++


### `Interpreter` read the whole code line by line and if it encounters the first error it will stop the execution it will not move forward.

Example -> ShellScript

### `Note` -> Javascript is not a purely Compiled as well as Intrepreted language .It uses the hybrid architecture to do things.

### `3` Types of Scopes 

1-> Global -> Accessible from anywhere inside the code.

2-> Block -> Accessible only inside that block

3-> Function -> Accesible inside the function .

**AutoGlobal**-> If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
